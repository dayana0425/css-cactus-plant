# Cactus Plant CSS Art

![cactus](css-cactus.png)

### The Process

1) I sketched out the design of the cactus plant & labeled the different components.

2) I built the HTML structure of the cactus plant by adding the divs and their associated labels as the class name in the index.html document.

3) I picked out the colors for each component (cactus, pricks, eyes, background color, circle, cheeks, outline) on colorhunt.co & then added them in a comment at the top my css document for reference.

4) I began writing CSS! Starting with the background elements and working my way up to the foreground elements. I utilized tutorials and Google to learn how to create basic shapes.

5) I kept modifying and making tweaks until I was happy with the final result!

Overall, I enjoyed creating css art. It was quite relaxing! :)
